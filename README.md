# miniBlockChain

Source: All the codes and the learnings are based on the HackerNoon 
        Article : https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46

Objective: To learn and write the minimal version of blockchain implementation using Python
Functionality Learned and Tested out:
            1. Create a blockchain with genesis block initialisation
            2. Add transactions to the Transaction Pool
            3. Mining the block and adding to the chain
            4. Minimal Proof of Work Implementation with difficulty = four leading zero (Hard coded)
            5. Blockchain Validation using hash validations throughtout the chain
            6. Register the node with neigbour nodes
            7. Resolve the blockchain conflicts based simple constraints i.e. Valid chain with maximum length will be considered authentic
Tools Used : VSCode, Postman
